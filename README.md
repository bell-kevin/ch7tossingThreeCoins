# ch7tossingThreeCoins

Using the same Coin class from the previous project, create a game that uses 3 instances of the Coin class, one representing a quarter, one representing a dime, and one representing a nickel. The user and the computer will each toss all 3 coins; the value of those coins that are heads up is added to the toss total. The one (user or computer) whose toss total is highest wins the toss and the toss total is added to that player's total score. This repeats as long as the user wants to play. When done, the total score for the user is compared to the total score for the computer; the highest value is the winner, and that player is rewarded with that total score * 10. For example, if the user's final total is 0.45 and the computer's final total is 0.40, the user wins and is awarded $4.00 (0.40 * 10). In the case of a tie, in the toss and in the final step, no value is awarded.

Here is an example of the first round:

Here is an example of the end:

![Ch 7 Match Coins last](https://github.com/bell-kevin/ch7tossingThreeCoins/blob/main/lastTurn.PNG)

Create a function that tosses the 3 coins, adds up the value of those coins which are heads up, and returns that total. 

Run the project and take screenshots of the first turn and the last turn, as shown above.

NOTE: Remember the requirements for a header and a pause at the end of the program, discussed in the reading "Console Applications". These are required in every console application project.

Submission: Submit a single zipped folder containing all of the specified screenshots AND the root folder for the project.

== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. I have a [website](https://bellKevin.me) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign 
from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not 
a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
email me at **bellKevin@pm.me** for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
